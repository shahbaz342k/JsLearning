Ans. See we have javascript language now js language will run and will executed by the browsers
like chrome, mozilla and others. How browser run javascript, basically every browser has a js
engine inside it.
like chorme has V8 engine , edge has chakra and mozilla has spider monkey
So inside chrome browser has a v8 engine which runs js code.
With the help of v8 engine node js is created as a wrapper over it.

As js only run on client side meanse only in browser. Now we have nodejs 
to execute js on server side.s
